Three types of tickets are sold at each presentation: general admission, senior citizen, and children. The theater management has asked you to prepare a worksheet, based on the revenue from a typical week that can be used in reevaluating its ticket structure. During an average week, weekly evening shows generate $7,540 from general admission ticket sales, $3,575 from senior citizen ticket sales, and $1,375 from children ticket sales. Weekend matinee shows make $5,500 from general admission ticket sales, $1,950 from senior citizen ticket sales, and $2,500 from children ticket sales. Weekend evening shows earn $8,540 from general admission ticket sales, $7,350 from senior citizen ticket sales, and $1,100 from children ticket sales.

The weekend matinee staff will receive a bonus if ticket sales for that period exceeds $10,000 and the entire team will receive a bonus if the Grand Total exceeds $40,000.
